# Amsterdam-Restaurant-Sentiment-Analysis

Amsterdam is one of my favourite places to visit for a nice long weekend.

Unfortunately, the food that my friends and I tend to ingest always leaves a lot to be desired.

This is what sparked this project, I decided to scrape the top rated restaurants from Yelp using Python and analyse the reviews in Power BI to see which one ranks highest based on the sentiment score.
